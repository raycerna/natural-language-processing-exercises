       "  'content': 'Come Work In The Cloud\\nWhen your Monday rolls around, do you start to get a sense of dread? That might be a sign to break up with your current job and learn something new.\\xa0At Codeup, we don’t want you to keep your head in the clouds while working a job you can’t stand. You should learn all about the cloud and cloud technology!\\xa0As we charge forward into 2022, we recently announced our brand new Cloud Administration Program.\\xa0\\nThis is a 15-week career accelerator that gets you hands-on experience with:\\n\\nNetworking\\nLinux Operating System\\xa0\\nWindows Operating System\\xa0\\nSecurity\\xa0\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Technology\\n\\nYou’ll earn two industry-recognized certifications as an AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate. Both are included as part of your tuition. You will learn how to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance.\\xa0\\nHere are 5 reasons why we think you should attend our Cloud Administration program:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.) The Campus\\xa0\\nLocated on Rackspace property, our Castle campus has everything you need.\\xa0Tabletop games to play with classmates on break? We got foosball and ping pong!\\xa0Need a drink to quench your thirst? We have complimentary soda, water, and tea.\\xa0\\nThere is also lots of seating across the campus for you to study, have lunch, or even meet with classmates.\\xa0\\nParking is free since we are located on Rackspace’s property. You have the option to park about 100 ft away from our building, or you can park on the underground level to save your car from the heat if you attend during the summer months.\\xa0\\nThere is also plenty of food options within driving distance of campus. Fast food options include Mcdonald’s, Panda Express, and Bill Miller’s BBQ. For more sit-down restaurant options, you can visit Applebee’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Olive Garden. If you want to bring your lunch we have microwaves and refrigerators to enjoy your lunch on campus.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2.) Time and Money Spent\\xa0\\nIn just 15 weeks you will be on your way to a new career that’s in high demand! That means you won’t have to wait 2 – 4 years like other traditional degree plans to get started in your new career.\\xa0\\nIs the cost of our program a concern? We totally understand if it is. Our Cloud Administration program is also the most affordable option of our three programs at Codeup if you’re looking to save the most money. It’s also more affordable than a traditional degree.\\xa0\\nAt Codeup we have a dedicated team of Financial Aid and Enrollment managers who will work with you one on one to ensure you have everything you need to pay for your time at Codeup that makes sense for your individual situation.\\xa0\\nWe have grants, scholarships, and student loans for those who qualify.

Salary & Benefits\\xa0\\nAlmost everyone changing careers during the “Great Resignation” is doing it for better pay and better benefits.\\xa0\\nWhat if I told you that any career you obtain through our Cloud Administration program offered you both a better salary and better benefits?\\xa0\\nAccording to Indeed.com the average salary for a Cloud Engineer right now is $118,712 in Texas (which is similar to the National average). This mirrors a Glassdoor Median Base salary of $118,999. Glassdoor also notes a job satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 and over 10K open roles under the title Cloud Engineer.\\xa0\\nAre you guaranteed a salary like that after graduation? Not necessarily since this was an average salary. However, what that means is you have the potential to get to that level of salary at some point in your new career.\\nYour new skill sets could land you at a larger company like Accenture, EY, or even USAA. On the other hand, you could end up at a small company like a startup or SaaS (software as a service) company.\\xa0\\nBoth of those options will typically give you things like a great health care plan, generous amounts of time off, and additional perks like continuing education and gym discounts. Startups might be a little more unique in their offerings like remote work options, paying for new office equipment, and even potentially paying for an annual company retreat if the company works remotely.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.) Job Security\\nAccording to IT senior managers in a recent Robert Half survey, cloud expertise is the topmost in-demand skill set. This means cloud experts are in high demand and will continue to be as more companies adopt cloud infrastructures. The curriculum you go through in this program won’t stick you to just one lane. Coming out of the Cloud Administration program you could land a job as a:\\xa0\\n\\nCloud Engineer\\nCloud Network Engineer\\xa0\\nCloud Security Engineer\\xa0\\nCloud Architect\\xa0\\nCloud Administrator\\xa0\\n\\nHaving this many career options to choose from makes you a valuable and in-demand candidate for any tech company big or small. At Codeup, we have an employer-influenced curriculum. So once you graduate, you are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge today’s employers are looking for.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5.) Our Instructors Are Next Level\\xa0\\nOur instructors genuinely care about your success. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you the answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change.\\xa0\\nAt other boot camps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live interactive lectures and lab. Even at the college level, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. Our instructors make a difference in your learning journey.\\xa0\\nIf having awesome instructors wasn’t enough, we also have a dedicated Student Experience team. This team is designed to work in collaboration with our instructors to ensure your success. Need a one-on-one session with your instructor? They can help with that. Need help just managing your time better? They can help with that too! These are passionate education professionals who want to empower you to get to that finish line we call graduation!\\xa0\\nRead more about why you need the best coding Bootcamp instructors here.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWrapping Up\\nAs we mentioned, as more companies adopt cloud technologies the demand for cloud experts will only continue to grow.
