5 Reasons To Attend Our New Cloud Administration Program,"Come Work In The Cloud
When your Monday rolls around, do you start to get a sense of dread? That might be a sign to break up with your current job and learn something new. At Codeup, we don’t want you to keep your head in the clouds while working a job you can’t stand. You should learn all about the cloud and cloud technology! As we charge forward into 2022, we recently announced our brand new Cloud Administration Program. 
This is a 15-week career accelerator that gets you hands-on experience with:

Networking
Linux Operating System 
Windows Operating System 
Security 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Technology

You’ll earn two industry-recognized certifications as an AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate. Both are included as part of your tuition. You will learn how to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance. 
Here are 5 reasons why we think you should attend our Cloud Administration program: 
 
1.) The Campus 
Located on Rackspace property, our Castle campus has everything you need. Tabletop games to play with classmates on break? We got foosball and ping pong! Need a drink to quench your thirst? We have complimentary soda, water, and tea. 
There is also lots of seating across the campus for you to study, have lunch, or even meet with classmates. 
Parking is free since we are located on Rackspace’s property. You have the option to park about 100 ft away from our building, or you can park on the underground level to save your car from the heat if you attend during the summer months. 
There is also plenty of food options within driving distance of campus. Fast food options include Mcdonald’s, Panda Express, and Bill Miller’s BBQ. For more sit-down restaurant options, you can visit Applebee’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Olive Garden. If you want to bring your lunch we have microwaves and refrigerators to enjoy your lunch on campus. 
 
2.) Time and Money Spent 
In just 15 weeks you will be on your way to a new career that’s in high demand! That means you won’t have to wait 2 – 4 years like other traditional degree plans to get started in your new career. 
Is the cost of our program a concern? We totally understand if it is. Our Cloud Administration program is also the most affordable option of our three programs at Codeup if you’re looking to save the most money. It’s also more affordable than a traditional degree. 
At Codeup we have a dedicated team of Financial Aid and Enrollment managers who will work with you one on one to ensure you have everything you need to pay for your time at Codeup that makes sense for your individual situation. 
We have grants, scholarships, and student loans for those who qualify. If you’re a Veteran or a dependant of a Veteran you might have GI Bill benefits for use at Codeup. We just launched an exclusive scholarship with Climb Credit that you can apply for here. 
Lastly, you can always go through your own financial institution to see what options are available to pay for Codeup. 
Check out a walkthrough of our financial aid options here. 
 
3.) Salary & Benefits 
Almost everyone changing careers during the “Great Resignation” is doing it for better pay and better benefits. 
What if I told you that any career you obtain through our Cloud Administration program offered you both a better salary and better benefits? 
According to Indeed.com the average salary for a Cloud Engineer right now is $118,712 in Texas (which is similar to the National average). This mirrors a Glassdoor Median Base salary of $118,999. Glassdoor also notes a job satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 and over 10K open roles under the title Cloud Engineer. 
Are you guaranteed a salary like that after graduation? Not necessarily since this was an average salary. However, what that means is you have the potential to get to that level of salary at some point in your new career.
Your new skill sets could land you at a larger company like Accenture, EY, or even USAA. On the other hand, you could end up at a small company like a startup or SaaS (software as a service) company. 
Both of those options will typically give you things like a great health care plan, generous amounts of time off, and additional perks like continuing education and gym discounts. Startups might be a little more unique in their offerings like remote work options, paying for new office equipment, and even potentially paying for an annual company retreat if the company works remotely. 
 
4.) Job Security
According to IT senior managers in a recent Robert Half survey, cloud expertise is the topmost in-demand skill set. This means cloud experts are in high demand and will continue to be as more companies adopt cloud infrastructures. The curriculum you go through in this program won’t stick you to just one lane. Coming out of the Cloud Administration program you could land a job as a: 

Cloud Engineer
Cloud Network Engineer 
Cloud Security Engineer 
Cloud Architect 
Cloud Administrator 

Having this many career options to choose from makes you a valuable and in-demand candidate for any tech company big or small. At Codeup, we have an employer-influenced curriculum. So once you graduate, you are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge today’s employers are looking for. 
 
5.) Our Instructors Are Next Level 
Our instructors genuinely care about your success. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you the answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change. 
At other boot camps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live interactive lectures and lab. Even at the college level, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. Our instructors make a difference in your learning journey. 
If having awesome instructors wasn’t enough, we also have a dedicated Student Experience team. This team is designed to work in collaboration with our instructors to ensure your success. Need a one-on-one session with your instructor? They can help with that. Need help just managing your time better? They can help with that too! These are passionate education professionals who want to empower you to get to that finish line we call graduation!

Inclusion at Codeup During Pride Month (and Always),"Happy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.
Cultivating Inclusive Growth
We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.
In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively.
Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.
Codeup Initiatives
To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students.
Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. 
Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.
If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now. Then, apply for our Pride Scholarship."
Mental Health First Aid Training,"As a student of Codeup, going through a massive career transition can be mentally taxing. Did you know that members of our student-facing staff and human resources team are trained in Mental Health First Aid? Let’s dive into what that means for Codeup! 
Mental Health First Aid Training 
Some of our Codeup staff that works directly with our students are trained in Mental Health First Aid. This includes members of our student experience team, career coaches, and the human resources department. This training was courtesy of the Center for Health Care Services in San Antonio. They graciously provided the funding and training for our team in this pilot training program. 
What is Mental Health First Aid? According to mentalhhealthfirstaid.org, “is a course that teaches you how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. The training gives you the skills you need to reach out and provide initial help and support to someone who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem or experiencing a crisis”.
To be clear, our staff are not licensed, mental health professionals. What MHFA equips our staff with are tools to gauge risk and connect students and staff with the help they might need. This might include recognizing something in a meeting, picking up on cues during a casual conversation, or acting on a pattern behavior. 
How does this help our students?
Many who go through Codeup’s programs will tell you it is both rewarding and challenging all at the same time. Some students have compared learning at Codeup to  “drinking from a firehouse”. You learn so much at once, so fast. This style of learning if you are not used to it can be taxing on anyone’s mental fortitude. This allows our staff who work closely with the students to be able to identify if a student is in need of mental health help. 
Consider Your Career Change Today
Why does this skill set matter? You! We’re here to support your career transition as best we can, and Mental Health First Aid training is just one small piece of that larger support effort. Learn more about how we can support your career transition by applying today."

Located on Rackspace property, our Castle campus has everything you need. Tabletop games to play with classmates on break? We got foosball and ping pong! Need a drink to quench your thirst? We have complimentary soda, water, and tea. 
There is also lots of seating across the campus for you to study, have lunch, or even meet with classmates. 
Parking is free since we are located on Rackspace’s property. You have the option to park about 100 ft away from our building, or you can park on the underground level to save your car from the heat if you attend during the summer months. 
There is also plenty of food options within driving distance of campus. Fast food options include Mcdonald’s, Panda Express, and Bill Miller’s BBQ. For more sit-down restaurant options, you can visit Applebee’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Olive Garden. If you want to bring your lunch we have microwaves and refrigerators to enjoy your lunch on campus. 
 
2.) Time and Money Spent 
In just 15 weeks you will be on your way to a new career that’s in high demand! That means you won’t have to wait 2 – 4 years like other traditional degree plans to get started in your new career. 
Is the cost of our program a concern? We totally understand if it is. Our Cloud Administration program is also the most affordable option of our three programs at Codeup if you’re looking to save the most money. It’s also more affordable than a traditional degree. 
At Codeup we have a dedicated team of Financial Aid and Enrollment managers who will work with you one on one to ensure you have everything you need to pay for your time at Codeup that makes sense for your individual situation. 
We have grants, scholarships, and student loans for those who qualify. If you’re a Veteran or a dependant of a Veteran you might have GI Bill benefits for use at Codeup. We just launched an exclusive scholarship with Climb Credit that you can apply for here. 
Lastly, you can always go through your own financial institution to see what options are available to pay for Codeup. 
Check out a walkthrough of our financial aid options here. 
 
3.) Salary & Benefits 
Almost everyone changing careers during the “Great Resignation” is doing it for better pay and better benefits. 
What if I told you that any career you obtain through our Cloud Administration program offered you both a better salary and better benefits? 
According to Indeed.com the average salary for a Cloud Engineer right now is $118,712 in Texas (which is similar to the National average). This mirrors a Glassdoor Median Base salary of $118,999. Glassdoor also notes a job satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 and over 10K open roles under the title Cloud Engineer. 
Are you guaranteed a salary like that after graduation? Not necessarily since this was an average salary. However, what that means is you have the potential to get to that level of salary at some point in your new career.
Your new skill sets could land you at a larger company like Accenture, EY, or even USAA. On the other hand, you could end up at a small company like a startup or SaaS (software as a service) company. 
Both of those options will typically give you things like a great health care plan, generous amounts of time off, and additional perks like continuing education and gym discounts. Startups might be a little more unique in their offerings like remote work options, paying for new office equipment, and even potentially paying for an annual company retreat if the company works remotely. 
 
4.) Job Security
According to IT senior managers in a recent Robert Half survey, cloud expertise is the topmost in-demand skill set. This means cloud experts are in high demand and will continue to be as more companies adopt cloud infrastructures. The curriculum you go through in this program won’t stick you to just one lane. Coming out of the Cloud Administration program you could land a job as a: 

Cloud Engineer
Cloud Network Engineer 
Cloud Security Engineer 
Cloud Architect 
Cloud Administrator 

Having this many career options to choose from makes you a valuable and in-demand candidate for any tech company big or small. At Codeup, we have an employer-influenced curriculum. So once you graduate, you are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge today’s employers are looking for. 
 
5.) Our Instructors Are Next Level 
Our instructors genuinely care about your success. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you the answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change. 
At other boot camps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live interactive lectures and lab. Even at the college level, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. Our instructors make a difference in your learning journey. 
If having awesome instructors wasn’t enough, we also have a dedicated Student Experience team. This team is designed to work in collaboration with our instructors to ensure your success. Need a one-on-one session with your instructor? They can help with that. Need help just managing your time better? They can help with that too! These are passionate education professionals who want to empower you to get to that finish line we call graduation!

Our Acquisition of the Rackspace Cloud Academy: One Year Later,"Just about a year ago on April 16th, 2021 we announced our acquisition of the Rackspace Cloud Academy! For a short time after the acquisition, it was rebranded as the Codeup Cloud Academy and is now a full-time part of the Codeup brand. You can read our blog when we announced this last year by clicking here. 
To look back at the past year, we checked in with Marcus Benavidez and Mike Jaime who stayed with Codeup after previously working with the Rackspace Cloud Academy. We also checked in with Dimitri Antoniou who is our VP of Strategic Initiatives and helped with the merger of the two companies. We asked them questions about the current campus, and also what the future may look like at Codeup’s new “Castle” campus. 
What makes Codeup’s new “Castle” campus so special?
Mike Jamie: Its history! Rackspace and former Rackers were instrumental in jumpstarting the tech industry here in San Antonio. This includes Geekdom, where Codeup was established. The Castle is where Rackspace ultimately decided to call its international headquarters. 
Marcus Benavidez: The campus is designed with the student experience in mind. This includes the large classrooms and facilities to match. It’s a piece of San Antonio history as it’s on the Rackspace Campus. 
Dimitri Antoniou: The Castle has been a staple of tech in San Antonio for years. Train new tech employees in high-growth careers like Cloud Administration from the Castle campus is an exciting extension of the legacy of Rackspace’s impact on San Antonio.
What new traditions have you created at the Castle or would to start since the acquisition?
Mike: A way to implement a version of “Rookie O” across staff and cohorts. 
Marcus: I would love to see some kind of Alumni wall or recognition for Alumni past, present, and future. 
Since it’s been 1 yr since the acquisition, where do you see our Castle campus in 3, 5, or even 10 years from now?
Marcus: It will be awesome once Web Development and Data Science programs are approved on this campus. I am looking forward to the cross-pollination of technologies, students, and staff. 
Dimitri: Maybe we will have our own mall to ourselves one day
What advice would you give to those considering our new Cloud Administration program?
Mike: If you’re looking to get your foot in the door, I think it’s a no-brainer as you will be learning AWS administration, which is the most in-demand cloud computing platform. Also, the decision to focus on hands-on experience and know-how as opposed to certification exam memorization will better prepare students with practical knowledge.
Marcus: Do it. The time to positively impact your life and to create change is now.
Dimitri: Skills in networking, Linux, and AWS can put you on a path to so many different careers, including cybersecurity and cloud architecture. These are some of the highest growth and most exciting pathways in technology. With experienced experts like Jeremy Price and Kris Connolly to teach you, there’s no better way to open doors in IT.
What programs could you see being delivered at the Castle campus in the future?
Mike: Cybersecurity again! Also Web Development and Data Science as well. 
Marcus: We should continue to build and offer classes that align with the market [i.e. what skills are in high demand]. 
Dimitri: AWS is one of 3 major cloud providers, along with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. I think it won’t be long until we’re training a variety of cloud careers across all major players.
The Castle has ping pong and foosball. What other indoor competitive game would you add?
Mike: Air Hockey and Shuffle Board
Marcus: Vintage Arcade games would be awesome! 
Dimitri: There’s so much open space – I’d love to run a nerf gun or dodgeball tournament!
